This project will be used to create a database user interface for Urban Archaeology.

The main goals of the project are to connect to the remote database, allow modification and manipulation of the data in the database, and create or delete data in the database.

The project will feature a data visualization pane, with filtering and searching functionality. It will also feature pages for adding products, posts, and newletters. The posts and newsletters will have a live preview of their appearance as they are generated using markdown.
